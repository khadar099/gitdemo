What is Git?

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) used to track changes in source code during software development.

In simple words:

It keeps a history of all code changes.

It allows multiple people to work together without overwriting each other’s work.

It helps you roll back to previous versions if something breaks.

It works offline, and code history is stored on every developer’s machine.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux) in 2005.



Why Do We Use Git? (Uses of Git)

1️⃣ Version control

Git tracks every change made to your files.
You can always go back to a previous working version.

2️⃣ Collaboration

Many developers can work on the same project at the same time without conflicts.

3️⃣ Branching & merging

You can create separate branches for:

New features

Bug fixes

Experiments

Then merge them back into the main code.

Git makes branching fast & lightweight.

4️⃣ Backup

Because every developer has a full copy, it’s almost impossible to lose the code.

5️⃣ Continuous Integration / Deployment

Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD work directly with Git.

6️⃣ Open-source contribution

Most open-source projects use Git and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

You commit changes locally → then push to remote.

🔁 Alternatives to Git

Git is the most used system today, but there are other Version Control Systems too:

⭐ 1. Subversion (SVN)

Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

Old but still used by some enterprises

Not distributed like Git

⭐ 2. Mercurial

Also a distributed version control system

Similar to Git but simpler

Used by companies like Mozilla (previously)

⭐ 3. Perforce (Helix Core)

Used heavily in gaming & large enterprises

Very good for large binary files

Fast, scalable

⭐ 4. CVS (Concurrent Versioning System)

Very old; used before SVN

Not common now

⭐ 5. IBM ClearCase

Enterprise-level, used in big corporations

Heavy and complex system

🥇 Which is best?

Git is the industry standard because:

Free & open-source

Distributed

Fast

Used by 95% of companies

Best community support
Local Repository	On your laptop
Remote Repository	On GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
You commit changes locally → then push to remote.
